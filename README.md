Simplog
=======

Simplog is a simple logger interface for your Node.js app, exposing a convenient browser log client for when ssh isn't available.

*Not meant for monitoring logs on distributed machines at this time.*

---

Requirements
------------

*   Socket.IO
*   Express
*   Jade

*These need to be installed alongside Simplog, and are not bundled with your install.*


Installation
------------

`sudo npm install Simplog`

*Note the capital S! NPM is case sensitive.*

...or direct from Git:

`sudo npm install https://github.com/sterlingwes/Simplog/tarball/master`

---

Usage
=====

Require()
---------

Take a look at `server_example.js` for the full example.

	var express = require('express'),
		app		= express.createServer(),
		io		= require('socket.io').listen(app),
		s		= require('Simplog');
		app.listen(80);

*Note* that on account of [this issue](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/500) with Connect/Express (specifically v3+) & Socket.IO, we should require `http` vs. `app.listen()`, per the following alternative:

	var express = require('express'),
		http	= require('http'),
		app		= express(),
		server	= http.createServer(app);
		server.listen(80);
		
	var	io		= require('socket.io').listen(server),
		s		= require('Simplog');

		
Configure Express
-----------------
		
Configure express to serve simplog browser client assets:

	app.configure(function() {
		app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/node_modules/Simplog/public'));
	});

	
Initialize
----------
	
Initialize Simplog, referencing your log files and socket.io.

	s.init({
		serverlog:	'server.log',
        errorlog:   'error.log'
	}, io);
	

Setup Browser Client
--------------------

Finally, setup the route to your browser client:

	app.get('/log', s.render);


Run!
----
	
Now, run your app and split your log output:

	sudo node server.js 1>>server.log 2>>error.log
	
Try using the Simplog logger in you application:

	s.log('Message'); 					// defaults to debug level 1, no label/namespace
	s.log('Message',2,'MainModule'); 	// info level 2, MainModule as label
	s.log('Message','MainModule'); 		// defaults to debug level
	s.log('Message',3);					// error level 3, no label
	console.log('Message');				// this and sys.log works fine (no formatting)
	
That's it! More thorough API documentation to follow.


Known Issues / To-do
---------------------

*   Browser client does not render exception traces gracefully
*   Does not support distributed logging
*	Does not detect exceptions / crashes (providing notifications)
